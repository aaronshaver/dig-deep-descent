            <h2>Dig: Deep Descent</h2>
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>You finally scraped together enough funds to purchase a modest mining vessel. After months
                of dull flight, you've arrived
                at the Outer Belt. You hope to be able to sell enough minerals to acquire
                1 billion Credits. That would be enough to secure a coveted berth on an Interstellar Fleet
                ship. You hope to finally escape this wretched, war-torn system for the promise of Proxima
                Centauri b and beyond. Besides your mining vessel, you have made contact with the
                OBTL (Outer Belt Trading League), who will buy minerals you recover. They will also
                provide upgrades, repairs, and fast-charging to your ship's batteries -- just be
                sure to make it back to the asteroid's surface in time!
