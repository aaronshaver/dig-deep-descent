            <h2>Dig: Deep Descent</h2>
            <h5>pre-alpha build 0.1</h5>
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You finally scraped together enough funds to purchase a modest mining vessel. After months
                of uneventful flight, you've arrived at the Outer Belt.</li>
                <li>Your goal is to sell enough minerals to acquire 1 billion Credits. That would be enough to
                    secure a coveted berth on an Interstellar Fleet ship. You hope to finally escape this wretched, war-torn system for the promise of Proxima
                Centauri b and beyond.</li>
                <li>You made contact with the
                OBTL (Outer Belt Trading League), who will buy minerals you recover. They will also
                provide upgrades, repairs, and fast-charging to your ship's batteries -- just be
                sure to make it back to the surface in time.</li>
                <li>As you dig deeper, more valuable minerals will appear, but so will more danger!</li>
            </ul>
