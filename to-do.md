## near-term

* continuing increasing test coverage

* feature: upgrade Depth -> Position with x, y, z (will need to calibrate around mid-points)
* feature: random light brown triangles animate while digging
* feature: correlate the # of triangles with the points of drill power to show increasing strength visually; i.e. 400 drill power should add more triangles than 100 power
* feature: introduce a slight delay on keypress so that you can't just zip through rocks or fly across the screen
* feature: add first mineral, and be sure to replace rocks with minerals rather than placing them on empty ground
* feature: suffix battery level with (warning) and (DANGER) for low battery levels
* feature: new class: VerticalHole and graphics to indicate it

## medium -term

* feature: white drill dot fades from white to black as correlated with percentage of battery
* feature: show “Please play on a desktop or laptop; mobile is not currently supported” if mobile is detected
* feature: visual indicator of drill at work... maybe a ring, maybe a different color dot
* feature: mouseover objects == show short description + stats like hit points of rocks
* feature: gems get bigger diameter as the colors get more valuable to give a sense of reward
* feature: be sure to have some one-time-use items in addition to permanent upgrades to make it feel like an expedition/stocking up
* feature: a graphical bar along the side to visually indicate depth

## long-term

* feature: add PayPal donation links at bottom of left and right columns
* feature: local storage of game data + New Game button which resets everything
